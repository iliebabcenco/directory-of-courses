# Mind Compilator

I did this project in learning purposes as a capstone project from Microverse after completing HTML 2.0 curriculum.
The design is the same of [PatashuleKE](https://www.behance.net/gallery/25563385/PatashuleKE) by [Mathew Njuguna](https://www.behance.net/mathewnjuguna) which I have used for learning purposes with customized content (programming languages courses).


## Description

Mind Compilator is a web application which allows study and improvement of programming languages. It helps to find the best learning content depending on the user's capabilities. 

At the moment it has three pages:
* main page with a searching bar, description and offers sections;
* result page with a filter bar and the results of filters;
* details page which contains detailed information about the user's choiche.


## Built With

- HTML5;
- CSS3;
- Bootstrap 5.0;
